What is the rule for underlining text that is not a link?
Don't do it. It's confusing and probably unnecessary.

How should the unvisited link color compare to the visited link color in terms of:
Brightness & Hue: It should be the same colour as the visited link but much brighter.
Visibility to color-blind users: Again, much brighter.

What is a "perceived affordance"? Hint: Google is your friend. (OK, not really, but the search is nice.)
how obvious [to the user] is it that the 'thing' will do what the designer intends it to / Does the thing look like it will do what it does. 
i.e. does a button look like a button? Or in this case, does the link look like a link?

When can you safely eliminate underlines for links?
Navigation bars and lists of links

Should you use blue for text? Why or why not?
No. Blue is usually the colour we ascribe to links, therefore having plain text in blue is inconsistent and could be confusing.

If for some shocking reason, your contextual links are not underlined (horrors!), what can you do to improve link 
discovery by users?
You could use hovering effects, you could make the link underline when you hover or make the link title pop up.

What are link titles and how might you use them?
Little bits of text that pop up when you hover over links. You can use them to increase navigability for your users.
