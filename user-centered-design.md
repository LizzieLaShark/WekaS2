Make your product effective for the consumer and the real-world things they need to do.

Use the same types of things, where possible. i.e. design, messages, icons etc

Keep it simple and don't overload with unnecessary info

Make it basic and easy for the user. They're busy doing their tasks, they dont have time to think about your shizz.

Design so that the user knows what's goin on. i.e. click a button, something happens so they know it's been clicked.

Design so that people know where they are and where they can go or are going, really easily.

design so that the user can complete tasks in different ways or sequences, if possible.

Make sure information is easy to get to and easy to read, don't unnecessarily provide too much information.

Make it easy to see when things so wrong and make it easy to get help when they do.

Design so that it's hard for the user to stuff up and when they do stuff up they can see why or how it has happened.

I agree with all of this so far. It's pretty basic stuff but I can see why it's also very important. If I had to pick 
the most important three I'd go with: Design for users and their tasks, use simple and natural dialogue (I'd lump 
'present info clearly' in with that) and provide adequate feedback.
